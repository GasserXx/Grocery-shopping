# Grocery-shopping
The project is an Android e-store application
## Project Keypoints
* PostgreSQLRemote Database
* MVVM Architecture
* Unit Testing: Of the database and remote connection with the database
* Hashing
## Built with
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): Default language used to build this project
* [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView): A ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data. Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines): A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): is an open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
* [Android Architecture Components](): a collection of libraries that help design robust, testable, and maintainable apps: Room (a SQLite object mapping library), LiveData (builds data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes), ViewModel (stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations)
* [Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding): A Jetpack support library that allows to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically
